## **Z2Uni | University Course Selection Assistant**  

### **Project Overview**  
Z2Uni is a university course selection assistant designed to help Sri Lankan A/L students find the best degree programs based on their Z-Score. The platform provides personalized course recommendations while allowing users to explore possible university options.  

### **Core Features & Functionality**  
- **Z-Score-Based Course Filtering:** Students enter their Z-Score and receive a list of matching university courses.  
- **Threshold Adjustment:** Users can set a percentage-based threshold (e.g., 40%) to expand the list of courses beyond their Z-Score.  
- **District & Stream Selection:** Course recommendations are customized based on the student's district and selected A/L stream.  
- **Aptitude Test Course Highlighting:** Courses requiring an aptitude test are marked with a **green dot**, ensuring applicants can plan accordingly.  
- **Dynamic Course Listing:** Users are encouraged to prioritize their dream courses while considering aptitude test-enabled options and backup selections.  

### **Beta Version Considerations**  
- **Currently in Beta:** Z2Uni is being refined for next year’s A/L batch. Some courses may appear incorrectly due to missing university conditions.  
- **Course Availability Awareness:** University Z-Scores can change yearly, so the tool helps students prepare for multiple possibilities.  
- **Future Enhancements:** Planned improvements include more accurate course condition filtering and better integration with university selection criteria.  

### **Technical Stack**  
- **Frontend:** React.js  
- **Backend:** Node.js with Express  
- **Database:** Firebase (or other database solutions for real-time data handling)  

### **Impact & Vision**  
Z2Uni aims to reduce uncertainty in the Sri Lankan university selection process by providing an easy-to-use, data-driven platform for students. By refining recommendations and integrating aptitude test insights, the tool supports informed decision-making for higher education applicants.
